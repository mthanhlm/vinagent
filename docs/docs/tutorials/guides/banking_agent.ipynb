    "Timely report for decision making in banking and finance organizations plays a very important role in operational efficiency, increase profit, and revenue growth. Thanks to automatic business report systems, many organizations can regulate their business policies and regulations adapting with market changes. Therefore, they will gain benefit in long-term compared with the organizations without automatic business reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, following financial crisis 2008, JPMorgan Chase invested in upgrading its financial reporting systems to provide daily insights into capital positions, liquidity, and risk. This timely report allows bank to optimize captial allocation dynamically, enabling swift resumption of share repurchases and dividend increases compared to competitors.\n",

    "Another example is DBS bank in Singapore makes a Digital Transformation revamped its financial reporting infrastructure with a centralized data lake and analytics tools, slashing month-end closing times from 12 days to just 3 days. These changes improved the operational efficiency and drove revenue growth.\n",
