    "May be, you are familiar with single agent design of Vinagent, which uses an LLM as brain to control tools and workflow of an application. However, as you develop many operational systems in many real enterprises, the operational procedure might be very complex, which requires a transformation from single-agent into multi-agent system over time. For example, you may have to tackle with the following challanges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single agent increases it's workload, therefore, it need too many tools in use, which in return making a poor decision about which tool to call next.\n",
    "- Context growing huge preventing agent from capturing the main important keypoints.\n",
    "- Multiple specialization areas requires a complex system of multi-agent to deal with (e.g. planner, researcher, math expert, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to tackle these, it is necessary to break your application into multiple agents, each agent has their own skills to be integrated into a multi-agent system. Comparing with single-agent, multi-agent system has a primary benefits are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity: Separate agents simplify development and debugging.\n",
    "- Specialization: Expert agents improve domain performance.\n",
    "- Control: Explicit communication improves transparency and governance.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are several ways to develop a multi-agent system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network: All agents can talk directly with each other, and each one decides whom to call next.\n",
    "- Supervisor: Agents only talk to a central supervisor, which decides the next agent to invoke.\n",
    "- Supervisor (tool-calling): A variant where agents act like tools, and the supervisor LLM decides which tool-agent to use and what arguments to provide.\n",
    "- Hierarchical: Supervisors can themselves have supervisors, enabling layered control structures.\n",
    "- Custom workflow: Agents only connect with specific subsets, with some flows being fixed and others allowing limited decision-making.\n",

    "Vinagent designs an advanced multi-agent solution with key strengths:\n",
    "- Specialized Agents: Each [single agent](https://datascienceworld-kan.github.io/vinagent/#component-overview) is fully equipped with its own LLM, tools, memory, skills, and authentication layer.\n",
    "- Shared Conversation: Agents collaborate seamlessly in the same conversation, enabling them to capture and utilize each other’s context.\n",
    "- Human-in-the-Loop: Users can directly participate and interact within the agent workflow.\n",
    "- Customizable Order: A Crew class allows flexible control over the sequence of agents in a conversation.\n",

    "Each agent member in a multi-agent system is setup from [Vinagent's Agent class](https://datascienceworld-kan.github.io/vinagent/get_started/basic_agent/#setup-an-agent). However, to empower these agents to join in the same conversation, we specifically design a class `AgentNode` as a Proxy Class, which will be implemented for each agent. While initializing a new Agent class, you need to do following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a specific class inherites the AgentNode.\n",
    "- Re-define `exec` method inside this class, which triggers invoking function (is one of `invoke, ainvoke, and stream`) inside. The behavior of triggers invoking function is similar as [Vinagent's Agent triggering](https://datascienceworld-kan.github.io/vinagent/get_started/async_invoke/)\n",
